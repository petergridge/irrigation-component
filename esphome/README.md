# Irrigation ESPHOME

The ESPHOME implemenation is a much simpler and more robust solution that I would recommend for any ESP32/8266 project.

For the irrigation project his has resulted in the switches and sensors being discovered automatically by HA.

The performance using the HA API is also much better than using MQTT and the code is more compact.
